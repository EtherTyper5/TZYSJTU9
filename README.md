# Sketch-Generation-with-Drawing-Process-Guided-by-Vector-Flow-and-Grayscale
This is the official implementation of the AAAI 2021 accepted paper "**Sketch Generation with Drawing Process Guided by Vector Flow and Grayscale**". Here we give some instructions for running our code.
## Examples
We give three examples that can be run directly (the hyperparameters of these three examples have been adjusted).
For the cat `python cat.py` 
For the dog `python dog.py` 
For the girl `python girl.py`
