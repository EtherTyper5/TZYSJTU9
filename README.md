# Sketch-Generation-with-Drawing-Process-Guided-by-Vector-Flow-and-Grayscale
This is the official implementation of the **AAAI 2021** accepted paper "**Sketch Generation with Drawing Process Guided by Vector Flow and Grayscale**". Our Supplementary Material is available at Baidu Netdisk (百度网盘) https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZZEmpuPXRNBPvG0WHbbPKA. The extraction code (提取码) is `1234`.
Here we give some instructions for running our code.
## Examples
We give three examples that can be run directly (the hyperparameters of these three examples have been adjusted).  
### Quick start
- To draw the cat: `python cat.py`
- To draw the dog: `python dog.py`
- To draw the girl: `python girl.py`
### Results
